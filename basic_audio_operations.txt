Mix add two WAV files: 
(Note: this averages the volumes, so each will be half as loud)
`sox -m addend1.wav addend2.wav out.wav`

Fully negate a WAV file:
(This would cancel with the original file)
`sox -v -1 old.wav new.wav`

Partially negate a WAV file:
(For use with cancelling a mix of two files)
`sox -v -0.5 old.wav new.wav`

Subtract WAV files:
`sox -m negated.wav total.wav difference.wav`
